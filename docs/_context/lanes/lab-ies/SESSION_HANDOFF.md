# Lab/IES Session Handoff

## Session purpose

This handoff records completed LAB-028 reference curation surfaces, preserves the permanent charter authority for both standing prompts, and records the proposed version-1 LAB-029 seam awaiting Program & Integrate approval.

## Identity

- App: `ControlStack Lab and IES Authority Lane`
- Lane: `lab-ies`
- Root: `C:\ControlStack_Worktrees\code-pilot-lab`
- Branch: `lane/code-pilot-lab`
- Gate: `lab-ies`
- Standing prompt authority: `docs/_context/lanes/lab-ies/LANE_CHARTER.md` contains both worker and orchestrator prompts
- Starting HEAD for LAB-028: `326c95a01570970bfc0205dca2be3bd34442acc6`
- Completed feature checkpoint: `569c53f5a6b89850abb80a753f4296535e3b5db8`
- Feature subject: `lab: checkpoint reference curation surfaces`
- Feature checkpoint confirmed on origin `lane/code-pilot-lab`
- Seam change: no
- Branch-HEAD guard checkpoint: `6d34e500d407d5335e5eebb317636a67a5e98618`

## Branch-HEAD guard

Before the first parcel and before every later parcel in the same worker run, the worker compares `LANE_STATE.md`'s `Recorded branch HEAD` with the actual branch HEAD. A mismatch stops parcel execution, produces the exact stale-state reply, and permits only memory reconciliation plus the full gate. The worker must not execute any queue item after discovering the mismatch in that run.

After every documentation push, only the `Recorded branch HEAD` field is refreshed in the working tree to the new actual HEAD and left unstaged. This deliberate marker avoids the impossible requirement for a commit to contain its own final hash and provides the next parcel boundary check inside the same batch.

## Completed queue item

`LAB-028-reference-curation-surfaces` is complete.

Exactly these two feature files were committed:

```text
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/reference_builder.html
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/curator.html
```

Patrick's browser screenshots showed the legacy Reference Builder loading missing `nvb/boards.json` and `nvb/drivers.json` endpoints, then generating `NVB-REF-GT-000001` and `NVB-REF-OPT-000002` with browser-created serials and `sealedAt` values despite incomplete evidence. Refresh cleared the data, proving it was ephemeral but not making the authority claim valid.

The replacement pages now create only non-authoritative in-memory working drafts and curation plans. They consume the committed component projection and immutable document-register contracts, syntax-check only caller-entered existing reference IDs, and leave identity, evidence verification, capability evaluation and assembly verification unresolved. No upload, persistence, clock/random ID, serial allocation, timestamp, resolver creation, approval, download or cross-lane implementation remains.

## Validation evidence

- Focused changed-file `lab-ies` execution for the two LAB-028 surface files: 255/255 passed.
- Independent full `lab-ies` gate: 255/255 passed.
- Gated feature commit execution: 255/255 passed.
- Failed, cancelled, skipped and todo counts were zero.

## Git and protected worktree state

The feature parcel was staged as exactly the two authorised surface files, committed and pushed.

The protected working-tree state after documentation closeout must remain:

- staged: 0;
- modified: 1 — only the unstaged `Recorded branch HEAD` synchronisation marker in `LANE_STATE.md`;
- untracked: 16;
- deleted: 0.

The 16 protected untracked paths remain exactly those recorded in `LANE_STATE.md`. In particular, these explicitly non-queued paths remain untouched:

```text
README.zip
docs/_context/ControlStack_summary_normalise_harness_spec.md
scripts/clear_chaff.ps1
```

No protected implementation, prototype or support path was cleaned, reset, restored, deleted, moved, staged or absorbed. `scripts/clear_chaff.ps1` was not executed. The donor root was not written.

The Selector-owned paths remained absent from the dirty inventory and were not touched:

```text
packages/workspace-kernel/selectorReferenceOptionsService.js
tests/selectorCascadeCorrectness.test.js
```

## Queue state and next action

- `LAB-016-nvb-offline-fixtures`: `done`.
- `LAB-017-reference-resolver-contract`: `done` and finally accepted by Program & Integrate.
- `LAB-018-nvb-resolution-contract`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-019-component-projection-contract`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-020-document-register-contract`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-021-emergency-selection-contract`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-022-reference-composition-kernel`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-023-nvb-lab-adapter`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-024-resolver-fixture-corpus`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-025-component-library-surface`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-026-document-equipment-surfaces`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-027-request-report-workflow`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- `LAB-028-reference-curation-surfaces`: `done` and confirmed on origin.
- Consolidated envelope: `LAB-018_023_027_BATCH_SEAM_ENVELOPE.md`, version 1, approved for all seven seams and implemented unchanged for LAB-027.
- `LAB-029-provenance-publication-surfaces`: `blocked` pending Program & Integrate approval of `LAB-029_SEAM_ENVELOPE.md`, version 1.
- Proposed seam-envelope full `lab-ies` gate: 255/255 passed.
- Ready items: none.

Program reported gate 45/45 passed, the approval decision committed and pushed, and its tree clean. No parallel or combined implementation is authorised.

LAB-022 remains governed by its ratified binary-composition policy: exactly two unique non-MERGED parents, immutable order-significant provenance, exactly matching photometric grids with no interpolation/resampling, and allocation/authority/approval/sealing outside the kernel. Duplicate or pre-composed parents, reordered or missing provenance, grid mismatch and governance-boundary crossings fail closed.

LAB-023 remains governed by the exact version-1 immutable Lab projection contract. It consumes only the committed LAB-018 resolution and LAB-017 safe identity projections; unresolved values remain explicit, no ID or timestamp is generated, and assembly verification remains null.

LAB-024 remains a bounded offline fixture corpus only. Every file is explicit demo/development evidence, contains no unsafe local path, secret or fabricated verified authority digest, and resolves only through committed safe development projections.

LAB-025 remains a Lab-only surface over committed immutable projections and in-memory document-register state. Patrick reported a 100% PASS against its browser checklist; no production authority or persistence claim was introduced.

LAB-026 remains a bounded Lab-only support workflow. Patrick's observed legacy `404` artefact link was removed; unresolved evidence is now non-clickable and all state remains entered/demo, unverified and non-persistent.

LAB-027 remains the approved additive handoff implementation. It preserves earlier fields without rekeying, keeps unresolved values explicit, passes only canonical artefact references and creates no persistent or sealed browser authority.

LAB-028 remains a bounded Lab-only reference-draft and evidence-curation workflow. Patrick's observed 404 catalogue loads and browser-fabricated GT/OPT identities were retired; the completed surfaces now stop at explicit non-authoritative drafts with identity and evidence verification unresolved.

LAB-029 version 1 is proposed as a read-only publication view over the committed safe identity, canonical host-free resolver and evidence-capability contracts. Offline fixture mode remains visibly unapproved; governed mode relies on Program-supplied safe projections. Resolver hosting, route-to-storage mapping, persistence, evidence acceptance, sealing, allocation, authentication, deployment and endpoints remain Program-owned.

LAB-017 remains governed by its approved version-1 envelope. Program retains all production allocation, live source reading, hosting, routing, persistence, authentication, CRM integration, deployment and endpoint ownership.

The next safe action is to send the committed LAB-029 version-1 seam envelope to Program & Integrate for approval. No LAB-029 implementation may start until that exact approval is recorded and the item becomes the single `ready` parcel.

## LAB-017 immutable completion receipt

The fenced block below is the canonical final receipt for Program & Integrate acceptance. It must be consumed verbatim. Any change to its seam, implementation, ownership, compatibility or validation fields invalidates the receipt and requires a new seam decision.

## Final Program acceptance acknowledgement

Program & Integrate accepted the immutable receipt above unchanged on 2026-07-20.

Program reported:

- final acceptance closed;
- Program gate passed 45/45;
- the acceptance checkpoint was committed and pushed;
- the Program tree was clean.

The immutable receipt remains byte-for-byte unchanged. Promotion to main is a separate Program & Integrate action and was not performed by the Lab lane. The later consolidated batch approval superseded the former LAB-018 hold; sequence progression is recorded separately in current lane memory.

## Prohibited actions retained

- no LAB-017 change outside the recorded version-1 approval without a new seam decision;
- no reverse-authority reconstruction, legacy alternative reference schema, diagnostic authority identity or unsafe governed path;
- no public resolver route, server implementation, HTML, fixture, Selector or Program ownership absorbed into the Lab contract;
- no parallel or combined implementation; only the current top `ready` parcel may run, but the same worker may advance sequentially through up to five successful closeouts;
- no reset, restore, clean, deletion or movement of protected dirty paths;
- no execution of `scripts/clear_chaff.ps1`;
- no donor write;
- no main or other-lane write;
- no Selector changes.

## Standing-role launch instructions

The authoritative standing worker and standing orchestrator prompts are stored in `LANE_CHARTER.md`. This handoff records current session state and points to the stable charter; it is not the prompt authority.

Start a fresh worker with exactly:

```text
Read docs/_context/lanes/lab-ies/LANE_CHARTER.md and act as the standing worker per the prompt recorded there.
```

Start a fresh orchestrator with exactly:

```text
Read docs/_context/lanes/lab-ies/LANE_CHARTER.md and act as the standing orchestrator per the prompt recorded there.
```
