- Feature subject: `lab: checkpoint offline NVB fixtures`
- Feature push: confirmed on origin `lane/code-pilot-lab`

## Connected capability state

- Write enabled: yes

## Latest completed parcel — LAB-016

Queue item `LAB-016-nvb-offline-fixtures` is complete.

Exactly these seven authorised files were changed and committed:

```text
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/nvb/board_platforms.json
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/nvb/derived_resolution.json
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/nvb/drivers_unique.json
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/nvb/lab_form.json
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/nvb/optics.json
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/nvb/spec_codes.json
packages/lab-kernel/ies-toolkit/nvb/systems.json
```

Verified outcome:

- the seven files are committed as a bounded offline development fixture snapshot and are not represented as the live RuntimeData authority source;
- the locked 16-field Lab form remains exact and unchanged;
- no schema was added or replaced;
- literal `today` status values were replaced with the fixed snapshot timestamp `2026-07-19T00:00:00`;
- the 60 mm opal direct baseline and two duplicated system-height descriptions were reconciled with their own structured records;
- derived optic rows align with the observed system families, worst-case labels and optic/spec-code records;
- repository search found no local path, file URL, UNC path, credential, secret, token or API key;
- no JavaScript, HTML, resolver, production database or cross-lane path was changed.

## Validation evidence

The connected app exposes the fixed `lab-ies` gate as the available changed-file and full validation path.

- Focused changed-file execution for the seven NVB fixture files: 159 tests, 159 passed, 0 failed, 0 cancelled, 0 skipped, 0 todo, exit code 0.
- Full `lab-ies` gate: 159 tests, 159 passed, 0 failed, 0 cancelled, 0 skipped, 0 todo, exit code 0.
- Gated feature commit execution: 159 tests, 159 passed, 0 failed, 0 cancelled, 0 skipped, 0 todo, exit code 0.
